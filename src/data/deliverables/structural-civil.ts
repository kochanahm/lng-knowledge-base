It establishes finished grade elevations for all areas, ensures positive drainage, and identifies major earthwork quantities. This drawing coordinates civil works with all other disciplines.`,

    commonMistakes: [
      'Inadequate drainage slopes (minimum 1%)',
      'Conflicts between utilities in corridors',
      'Not considering construction access',
      'Insufficient laydown areas',
      'Poor coordination with existing utilities',
      'Underestimating settlement of filled areas'
    ],
    
    qualityChecklist: [
      'Drainage achieves positive flow',
      'All equipment foundations accommodated',
      'Road grades suitable for heavy transport',
      'Utilities do not conflict',

    realWorldExamples: [
      'Minimum road grades: 0.5%, maximum 8% for heavy loads',
      'Drainage slopes: 1-2% minimum for paved areas',
      'Typical cut/fill: Â±3m from existing grade',
      'Laydown areas: 20-30% of process area'
